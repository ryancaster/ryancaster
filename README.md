Architect of elegant systems and connoisseur of efficient code. Specializing in making machines do what I want, not what you think they should do.

Current mission: Elevating mediocre codebases to slightly-less-mediocre status.

Open source contributor. Mostly because it's easier to fix things myself than wait for others to do it wrong.
